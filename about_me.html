  Hi, my name is Seth. I studied Russian and German at Ohio State, and
  then went on to Uni Salzburg / Bowling Green. I also lived in Europe (Munich, Salzburg) for two
  years. After school, I spent nearly 9 years at Glassdoor as a Product Analyst and People Manager
  on the product and localization/internationalization team.  I have successfully led L10n and i18n
   projects, such as scaling and improving customer service responses and SLA, managing the
   localization marketing materials and help articles, algorithmically identified high ROI content
   for localization, and managed projects involving vendors or the integration of translation
   software.  I really enjoyed the technical side the of my job
  of my job and decided to make the transition from product to engineering.

  Outside of work, I enjoy camping, riding my motorcycle, reading, and writing. Some highlights
  include camping in blizzard conditions, riding my motorcycle from Cleveland to Charlotte, and
  finishing the first draft of my novel in 2021 using an Underwood typewriter from the 1920&apos;s.
